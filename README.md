# ComfyUI: m9 Prompts

Custom nodes for [comfyanonymous/ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

Two custom nodes are included for modifying a prompt to create prompt variations.
   * ScramblePrompts [m9]: Reorder prompts, remove prompts, modify weights
   * TweakWeights [m9]: Modify the weights of prompts matching keywords

## Overview

You may use these nodes as your positive/negative prompt, or combine them with other prompt nodes.

### Common Connectors

   * **clip**: Input. Standard clip connector
   * **conditioning_optional**: Input (optional). If you have another prompt node, you may combine the output of both nodes by connecting the CONDITIONING output of the other node into this input.
   * **CONDITIONING**: Output. Standard output. Connect this to your KSampler input.
   * **seed_optional**: Input (optional).  Recommended to convert this to an input when you want the variation to be deterministic based on the seed.  Otherwise, the same seed could produce different variants.

### Common Fields

   * **prompt**: This is the text prompt that will be modified to create a variation. The extent to which the text prompt is modified depends on node settings.
   * **print_output**: When enabled, output will be sent to the command window describing the new prompt.

## ScramblePrompts [m9] 

Modifications to the prompt may include:
   * Changing the order of prompts
   * Removing prompts
   * Changing the weight of prompts

A 'prompt' is a phrase between commas, but not inside of parenthesis.  If you have parenthesis between commas, it is considered a single prompt.  For example:
- prompt one, prompt two
- prompt (one), prompt two
- (prompt, one), prompt two

### Prompt Order

  * **order_prompts_percent**: The percent of prompts to reorder.

### Prompt Reduction

   * **remove_prompts_percent**: The number of prompts to remove.
     * prompts are removed entirely
     * Does not include Loras
   * **keep_prompts**: A list of keywords for prompts to keep.
     * As long as a prompt includes the specified keyword, it will not be removed
     * Comma delimited

### Prompt Weight

   * **modify_weights_percent**: The percent of prompts that will have the weight changed.
   * **weight_range**: The maximum amount to modify the weight in either direction.
     * If a change would take the weight below zero, the weight will be left as is
   * **max_weight**: Maximum final weight.
     * When a change will take the weight over the max, the change is not made
     * For example, if the weight is 1, the max is 1.2, and the change is +0.3, the weight will be left at 1
